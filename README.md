# Singup_Form

This project was made during the completion of The Odin Project. In this project I decided to use utility-CSS paradigm for styling as much as possible.
Lessons learned:
- This paradigm is well-suited for building consistent interfaces
- Without taking advantage of front-end frameworks, it becomes cumbersome to reuse the same set of classes for similar elements over and over again
